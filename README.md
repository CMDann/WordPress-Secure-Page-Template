WordPress-Secure-Page-Template
==============================
<a href="https://coderwall.com/cmdann"><img alt="Endorse CMDann on Coderwall" src="https://api.coderwall.com/cmdann/endorsecount.png" /></a>

This template creates a secure page. The contents of the page can only be displayed if the user is registered and logged in. This is not total security but it does prevent unregistered users from getting access to a portion of your website.

this form will also display a login form for the user when the user is not loggin in. You can style this with CSS.

Useage
======

Just upload securepage.php to your theme folder and you will be able to set the page template to the secure page.

You will have to style the login form. You can see the page in action here:
